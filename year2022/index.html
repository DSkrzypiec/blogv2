As the first highlight of year 2022 I wanted to mention the continuation of most
    of habits that I've started in 2021. I'm still jog regularly. I tried to
    learn Russian somehow regularly over the year. I had some breaks but generally I
    learned a bit and didn't forget what I've learned in 2021. I still do pull ups
    and chin ups on daily basis. I've run three (3km, 6km and 6km)
<a href="https://www.runmageddon.pl">Runmageddons</a> in 2022! There are plans for going
    for 12km in 2023. I'm also still amazed by quality of my Macbook Air M1, after
    almost two years now. Battery still can make over 10 hours of work on single
    charging. The last one is not a habit, but I wanted to mention it here.
</p> <h2 id="russian-aggression" class="chapter" data-astro-cid-5d3zeytc> <a href="#russian-aggression" data-astro-cid-5d3zeytc>Russian aggression on Ukraine</a> </h2>  <p> <em>[This paragraph was added on 2023-01-25]</em> </p> <p>
It was very sad and shocking moment when Russian army actually attacked Ukraine.
    I wanted just highlight single event in this regard. Around a week after the war
    has begun at Friday night I've got a call from my colleague (and team member at
    that time) if I could drive to Polish-Ukraine border to help him pick up part of
    his family. They were evacuating Ukraine. I agreed, started getting ready and in
    an hour we met. I knew from my parents that there is problem with gas
    availability in regions near the Ukrainian boarder so we've tried to refuel
    around 100km from Warsaw. Fortunately there was gas available but queue on this
    gas station took about an hour. In about 4 hours we make it to the border. It
    was already after midnight. My colleague was in touch with his family all the
    time but it was really hard to tell for them what is actually happening. They
    knew that they are close to border crossing but they couldn't estimate how long
    it would take. We slept 3-5 hours in the car. Finally around 2-3pm next day they
    arrived on Polish side and we've met.
</p> <p>
I'm describing this, because it was definitely an experience like no other.
    Ukrainian on average needed to travel for 2-5 days across whole country to get
    to Polish boarder. They were exhausted, stressed, hungry and lost. On the other
    hand it was great to see that many Poles come to help. There was like 50-100
    cars just at that night. There was food, clothes, rugs, dippers and other needed
    stuff gathered and prepared for refugees.

In August 2021 I've left Allegro Pay and joined
<a href="https://www.tcl.com/global/en">TCL</a> Research Europe. Regarding my time in
    Allegro I've wrote up <a href="https://dskrzypiec.dev/allegropay/">a summary</a>.
</p> <p>
I've joined TCL Research to maintain and expand their Overseas Big Data
    Platform. It's very interesting experience so far. Most of services are deployed
    on AWS or Alibaba Cloud. Whole infrastructure is defined as a code within AWS
    CDK and is developed by data engineers and not DevOps. Also here for the first
    time I started using Scala and Spark (via AWS Glue jobs). It was definitely a
    good experience. I immediately liked both Scala and writing data transformation
    using Spark. Using those technologies we've implemented end-to-end and
    integration tests for most of significant part of the platform, including
    dynamically deploying dedicated infrastructure. Many new technologies and all
    embedded in AWS. Very interesting so far indeed!
</p> <p>
In TCL we also primarily speaks in English. It was a good change after working
    for last two years in Polish-speaking teams. I see clear improvement of my English
    pronunciation and speaking in general after a few months.
</p> <h2 id="carbon-steel-wok" class="chapter" data-astro-cid-5d3zeytc> <a href="#carbon-steel-wok" data-astro-cid-5d3zeytc>Using carbon steel wok</a> </h2>  <p>
Around July-August this year I've got my first carbon steel wok. Till that point
    I've owned and used only Teflon-coated nonstick pans. Initially I had to scrub
    and season the wok. It was a bit difficult at first, because I was using
    induction stove. Over time I've improved it using actual fire.
</p> <p>
The difference between Teflon nonstick pans and carbon steel wok is huge! Wok is
    getting hot faster and reaches higher temperature overall. After using it for
    some time, now Teflon pans feels like it doesn't heat at all. Because of those
    characteristics cooking with carbon steel wok require different technique.
    Usually food is fried faster and needs to be stir-fried with constant moving
    food around the wok. Vegetables prepared with wok have unique texture. They are
    cooked well close to outside but kind of fresh inside. For me this is ideal.
</p> <p>
Deep frying is much better in wok, then in other pans. I think it's because of
    much higher temperature of oil. Food seems to not absorb oil at all!
</p> <p>
Using wok enhanced my cooking. I cook basically daily now. Preparing lunch with
    wok is 20 minutes total, including preparing ingredients. Now I like to cook
    my food by myself more then ordering a take-out.
</p> <h2 id="turned-thirty" class="chapter" data-astro-cid-5d3zeytc> <a href="#turned-thirty" data-astro-cid-5d3zeytc>I turned thirty</a> </h2>  <p>
This year I turned thirty. It wasn't any special really. My only goal for
    entering my thirties was to be in better physical shape, then in all years in my
    twenties. I definitely accomplish that.
</p> <h2 id="table-tennis" class="chapter" data-astro-cid-5d3zeytc> <a href="#table-tennis" data-astro-cid-5d3zeytc>Getting back to table tennis</a> </h2>  <p>
After few years I've get back to training table tennis again. I wasn't a pro
    player but I enjoy it. It's good to join regular trainings again. It's both
    super fun and quite an exercise.
</p> <h2 id="knife-sharpening" class="chapter" data-astro-cid-5d3zeytc> <a href="#knife-sharpening" data-astro-cid-5d3zeytc>Improved my knife sharpening skills</a> </h2>  <p>
Over the last few years I've been sharpening my knives on whetstone but quality
    of those tries wasn't very much stable. I couldn't get consistent and sharp
    results every time. I thought it was because of my whetstone quality or
    incorrect gradation. After I've watched
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Burrfection">Burrfection</a> has sharpen a knife on a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoEZI82-M_k">brick (!)</a> I've got convinced that
    the most important is a technique. I adjusted my technique afterwards and
    started practice more often. Currently I'm getting definitely better, regarding
    sharpness, and more consistent results. I'm very glad that I've improved this
    skill.
</p> <h2 id="home-app" class="chapter" data-astro-cid-5d3zeytc> <a href="#home-app" data-astro-cid-5d3zeytc>Home App rewritten and moved online</a> </h2>  <p>
In November I've <a href="https://dskrzypiec.dev/home-app-go/">rewritten Home App in Go</a>
and moved it online. I'm very satisfied with this decision and final result.

</p> <h2 id="aws-certification" class="chapter" data-astro-cid-5d3zeytc> <a href="#aws-certification" data-astro-cid-5d3zeytc>AWS Certification</a> </h2>  <p>
A week before Christmas I've received my first AWS certificate - Solutions
    Architect Associate (SAA-C03). Learning for the exam was for sure a fruitful
    experience. I've better high level picture of AWS. I also strengthen my
    foundations and get know many details I didn't know before.
</p> <p>
I general I'm still not really a fan of certification but I have to admit that
    AWS exams have pretty high level and contains actual real-life scenarios
    regarding system design in the cloud.
</p> <h2 id="summary" class="chapter" data-astro-cid-5d3zeytc> <a href="#summary" data-astro-cid-5d3zeytc>Summary</a> </h2>  <p>
In summary I think year 2022 was pretty good year for me. I've improved my
    professional skills regarding AWS and cloud in general. In hobby area in this
    year I focus on cooking and exercising. I improved my pizza making skill. I made
    croissants. I started using carbon steel wok. I learned a bunch of rice and rice
    cookers. Now I'm looking forward to 2023!
